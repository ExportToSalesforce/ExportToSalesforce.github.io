					<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website and chrome extension.</p>

					<h4>What do we do with your LinkedIn and Salesforce data?</h4>

					<p>We do not access, change, or store any of your LinkedIn or Salesforce information/data.  When you login and download our chrome extension, we simply ask for access to read your LinkedIn page to collect the public profile data, and read the Salesforce page so we can place the information in the appropriate fields.  We do keep your email address on file for customer tracking purposes.</p>

					<h4>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or chrome extension?</h4>

					<p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, other details to help you with your experience.</p>


					<h4>When do we collect information?</h4>

					<p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, fill out a form or enter information on our site, or download our chrome extension.</p>

					<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>

					<p>We may use the information we collect from you when you download our chrome plugin, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
						<li>To improve our website in order to better serve you.</li>
						<li>To improve our chrome extension in order to better serve you.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>How do we protect visitor information?</h4>

					<p>Our website and chrome extension is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site, and use of our product, as safe as possible.</p>

					<p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>

					<h4>Do we use 'cookies'?</h4>

					<p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>

					<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

					<p>If you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>

					<h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4>

					<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

					<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

					<h4>Third Party Links</h4>

					<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

					<h4>Google</h4>

					<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>

					<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

					<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

					<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
